# NNTrainning_ParkinsonsData_beginner

This repository is meant to be a guide/tutorial to train a basic neural network using Keras package. The dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the feature extraction methods for general voice disorders.

I have added the juypyternotebook file, model.h5 file, and the csv file for your reference.

The original paper for the dataset: 'Exploiting Nonlinear Recurrence and Fractal Scaling Properties for Voice Disorder Detection', Little MA, McSharry PE, Roberts SJ, Costello DAE, Moroz IM. BioMedical Engineering OnLine 2007, (26 June 2007)
